/*
A DOM Exception in JavaScript occurs when an error related to the Document Object Model (DOM) is encountered. 
This can happen while manipulating elements, attributes, events, or any part of the DOM that violates the rules or limitations of the API.

Common Causes of DOM Exceptions:
Invalid or Restricted DOM Actions: Trying to modify or access elements in a way that's not allowed.
Example: Attempting to append a child to an element that doesn't allow children.
Invalid Parameters: Passing an incorrect argument to a DOM method.
Violating the DOM Structure: Attempting to manipulate nodes in a way that disrupts the document structure.

Handling DOM Exceptions: To handle DOM exceptions gracefully, you can use try...catch blocks to catch and manage errors.

Best Practices to Avoid DOM Exceptions:
Validate Input: Ensure all parameters passed to DOM methods are valid. Example: Use document.querySelector carefully with valid selectors.
Check Element Existence: Ensure elements exist before performing operations.
Respect DOM Hierarchy: Avoid inserting nodes in inappropriate places.
Handle Asynchronous Operations Carefully: Ensure that the DOM is fully loaded before manipulating it (DOMContentLoaded event).
