/*
Here's a detailed breakdown of your JavaScript code, explaining each line and its purpose:

fullName = "Yatharth";
Purpose: Declares a variable fullName and assigns a value.
Explanation: The variable fullName is initialized with the string "Yatharth". Note that this variable is declared without using 
var, let, or const, which means it becomes a global variable (not recommended in strict coding practices).

console.log("fullName");
Purpose: Outputs the string "fullName" to the console.
Explanation: This logs the literal string "fullName" rather than the value of the variable. 
It will display fullName in the console, not its value.

console.log(fullName);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable fullName to the console.
Explanation: This logs the actual value of fullName, which is "Yatharth".

age = 20;
Purpose: Declares a variable age and assigns a value.
Explanation: The variable age is initialized with the numeric value 20. 
Like fullName, this is also declared without var, let, or const, making it a global variable.

console.log("age");
Purpose: Outputs the string "age" to the console.
Explanation: This logs the literal string "age" to the console.

console.log(age);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable age to the console.
Explanation: This logs the current value of age, which is 20.

pi = 3.14;
Purpose: Declares a variable pi and assigns a value.
Explanation: The variable pi is initialized with the floating-point number 3.14, again without var, let, or const.

console.log("pi");
Purpose: Outputs the string "pi" to the console.
Explanation: This logs the literal string "pi" to the console.

console.log(pi);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable pi to the console.
Explanation: This logs the value of pi, which is 3.14.

x = null;
Purpose: Declares a variable x and assigns a null value.
Explanation: The variable x is initialized with null, which represents the intentional absence of any object value.

console.log(x);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable x to the console.
Explanation: This logs the value of x, which will be null.

y = undefined;
Purpose: Declares a variable y and assigns an undefined value.
Explanation: The variable y is initialized with undefined, 
which indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.

console.log(y);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable y to the console.
Explanation: This logs the value of y, which will be undefined.

isFollow = false;
Purpose: Declares a variable isFollow and assigns a boolean value.
Explanation: The variable isFollow is initialized with the boolean value false.

console.log(isFollow);
Purpose: Outputs the value of the variable isFollow to the console.
Explanation: This logs the value of isFollow, which is false.
