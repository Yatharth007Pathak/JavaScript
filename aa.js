JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages.
JavaScript is a programming language primarily used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. 
It is one of the core technologies of web development, alongside HTML (for structure) and CSS (for styling). 
JS runs directly in web browsers, making it client-side, though it can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.

Hereâ€™s what makes JavaScript popular and useful:
Interactivity: JavaScript allows for things like animated graphics, clickable buttons, form validations, 
and real-time updates (e.g., showing notifications or live chat features).
Dynamic Content: It can update content on a page without requiring a reload. 
For example, when you like a post on social media, JavaScript updates the counter instantly.
Event Handling: JavaScript responds to events like clicks, key presses, or mouse movements, enabling responsive user experiences.
Browser Compatibility: JavaScript is natively supported by all major browsers, so users don't need to install extra plugins.

It has a vast ecosystem of libraries (like jQuery, React) and frameworks (such as Angular, Vue) 
that make development faster and more efficient.

JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation. 
Eich developed the language in just 10 days, originally calling it "Mocha," then renaming it to "LiveScript," 
and finally to "JavaScript" to leverage the popularity of Java, which was another language widely discussed at the time.

/*
In JavaScript, you can add comments to explain code or make notes, which helps improve code readability. 
There are two types of comments in JavaScript:Single-line comments and Multi-line comments
*/

// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment. 
It can span multiple lines and is useful for longer explanations. 
*/

// Avoid nesting /* */ multi-line comments within each other, as this will cause errors.
