/*
Code Breakdown:-

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }
Purpose: A for loop that runs 10 times, starting with i = 0 and ending when i reaches 9.
Initialization (let i = 0): Declares a loop control variable i and initializes it to 0.
Condition (i < 10): The loop will continue executing as long as i is less than 10.
Increment (i++): After each iteration, i is incremented by 1.

console.log("Yatharth Pathak");
Purpose: Logs the string "Yatharth Pathak" to the console during each iteration of the loop.
Execution: Since the loop runs 10 times, the string will be printed 10 times.
