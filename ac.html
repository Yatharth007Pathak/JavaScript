<!--
Here’s a breakdown of this minimal HTML document setup with a JavaScript file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
Specifies that the document type is HTML5.

<html lang="en">
<html>: The root element of the HTML document.
lang="en": Declares the document’s language as English.

<head>
The <head> section contains metadata about the document, such as character encoding, 
title, viewport settings, and linked resources like CSS or JavaScript files.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
Specifies UTF-8 character encoding, which covers most characters from different languages.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Makes the page responsive by setting the viewport width to match the device’s width and a 1:1 scale, 
so the page looks good on mobile and desktop screens.

<title>Document</title>
Sets the title that appears in the browser tab.

<script src="ac.js"></script>
This <script> tag links to an external JavaScript file named ac.js. When the page loads, 
the browser will execute the JavaScript code contained in ac.js.

<body>
The <body> tag is empty here but is where the visible page content would go, such as text, images, buttons, etc. 
JavaScript from ac.js can interact with this content.

</body> and </html>
These closing tags mark the end of the <body> content and the HTML document.
