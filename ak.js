/*
Here's a detailed breakdown of your JavaScript code defining the profile object and its properties:

const profile = { username: "@yatharth7pathak", isFollow: false, followers: 2212, following: 108 };
Purpose: Declares a constant profile and assigns it an object with properties related to a social media profile.
Explanation: The const keyword ensures that the profile variable cannot be reassigned, 
but you can still modify individual properties within the object if needed.
Object Structure: The profile object includes the following properties:
username: "@yatharth7pathak" — a string representing the profile's username or handle.
isFollow: false — a boolean indicating whether the profile is currently being followed.
followers: 2212 — a number representing the total count of followers.
following: 108 — a number representing the total count of profiles this user is following.

console.log(profile);
Purpose: Logs the entire profile object to the console.
Output: { username: "@yatharth7pathak", isFollow: false, followers: 2212, following: 108 }
Explanation: This displays the complete profile object, showing each property and its associated value.
