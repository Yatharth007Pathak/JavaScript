// A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

function sum(a, b){

/*
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of the JavaScript code:

function sum(a, b){
This defines a function named sum that takes two parameters, a and b.

console.log(a + b);
Inside the sum function, it logs the result of adding a and b to the console.

}
This closes the sum function.

function calculator(a, b, sumCallback) {
This defines another function named calculator, which takes three parameters: a, b, and sumCallback. 
The sumCallback is expected to be a function (in this case, the sum function).

sumCallback(a, b);
Inside the calculator function, it calls the sumCallback function (which will be sum) and passes a and b as arguments to it.

}
This closes the calculator function.

calculator(3, 4, sum);
Finally, the calculator function is called with the values 3 and 4 for a and b, 
and the sum function is passed as the sumCallback argument. This will invoke the sum function and log the sum of 3 and 4 to the console.
