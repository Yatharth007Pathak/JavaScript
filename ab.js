You can run JavaScript directly in the Console tab of the Chrome DevTools. Here’s how you can do it:

Open Chrome DevTools: Right-click anywhere on the main screen of the webpage and select Inspect from context menu
or press Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Option + I on macOS.

Go to the Console Tab: Click on the Console tab in the DevTools panel.

Clear the Console (Optional): Press Ctrl + L to clear any existing output in the console window.

Type Your JavaScript Code: You can enter any valid JavaScript code directly in the console. For example, you can try:
console.log('Hello, World!');

Press Enter: After typing your code, press Enter to execute it. You should see the output or any errors in the console.

The Console is a great tool for testing snippets of code, debugging, and interacting with the webpage’s DOM.


In the Chrome DevTools Console, pressing Ctrl + R (or Cmd + R on macOS) will refresh the page. 
This action will reload the current webpage and clear the console output.
If you want to simply clear the console without refreshing the page, you can use Ctrl + L instead.
