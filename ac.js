/*
Here's a line-by-line breakdown of our JavaScript code:

console.log("Jai Shree Ram");
Purpose: Logs a message to the console. console.log() is used to print messages to the console (visible in browser developer tools).
Explanation: This command sends the text "Jai Shree Ram" to the browser's console, which is a tool used for debugging and viewing output.

console.log("Har Har Mahadev");
Purpose: Logs another message to the console.
Explanation: This command sends "Har Har Mahadev" to the console, displaying it under the previous line.

console.log("Hare Krishna");
Purpose: Logs yet another message to the console.
Explanation: The string "Hare Krishna" appears in the console after the previous log statements, creating a sequence of messages.

alert("I am learning JavaScript");
Purpose: Displays an alert dialog box. alert() displays a pop-up alert dialog box with a specified message.
Explanation: This command creates a pop-up alert with the text "I am learning JavaScript", 
which will stay on the screen until the user clicks "OK."

alert("Hello Yatharth");
Purpose: Displays another alert dialog box.
Explanation: This command triggers another pop-up alert showing "Hello Yatharth", which will also require the user to click "OK" to proceed.

In summary:
console.log() is used for output to the console (often for debugging or logging).
alert() creates pop-up dialog boxes with messages that pause code execution until dismissed.

To run a CSS file, you'll typically include it in an HTML file, as CSS is used for styling HTML content. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Create an HTML File: First, create an HTML file where you will link your CSS file e.g index.html

2. Create a CSS File: Now, create a CSS file that you want to link to your HTML e.g styles.css

3. Open the HTML File in a Web Browser:
Open the HTML file (e.g. index.html) in a web browser by double-clicking it or right-clicking and selecting "Open with." 
or simply click Go Live on your HTML file to run live server.

/*
To run a JavaScript file, you have several options depending on your environment. Here are a few common methods:

1. Using a Web Browser: 
Create an HTML file: If your JavaScript file is meant to run in a web browser, 
you can include it in an HTML file and open that file in a browser. e.g index.html

Create a JS File: Now, create a JS file that you want to link to your HTML e.g script.js

Open the HTML File in a Web Browser: Open the HTML file (e.g. index.html) in a web browser by double-clicking it or 
right-clicking and selecting "Open with." or simply click Go Live on your HTML file to run live server.
You should see the JS content as defined by your JS file in Console tab when you right click on screen and select Inspect from context menu



2. Using Node.js: If you want to run JavaScript on the server side or outside of a browser, you can use Node.js.
Install Node.js from nodejs.org if you haven't already.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where your JavaScript file is located using the cd command. For example: cd path/to/your/javascript/file
Run the JavaScript file using Node.js: node yourfile.js

3. Using Online Editors
You can also run JavaScript code using online editors like:
CodePen (https://codepen.io/)          JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/)          Repl.it (https://replit.com/)
Simply create a new project and paste your JavaScript code to see it run immediately.
